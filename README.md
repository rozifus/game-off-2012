## Game

- The objective of the game is to merge all the colored blocks together until only grey blocks remain. 
- Different actions can be performed on blocks based on the hues they contain:
  - Yellow - Can be pushed
  - Red - Can be pulled
  - Blue - Can be ghosted (passed through)
  - Grey - Can't do anything, other than get in your way!
- Be careful not to trap yourself or place the blocks into positions that you can't get them out of.
- If you do get stuck, you can refresh the page to reload the level.

## Libraries Used
* [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) - The very awesome javascript game library.
* [(BKCore) Three.js-extensions](https://github.com/BKcore/Three.js-extensions/) - Nifty extensions for three.js.
* [HexGL](https://github.com/BKcore/HexGL) - Very impressive HTML5 game. I used this as a starting point for Gitium Chromoblockatics and as a reference for how to do object oriented programming in javascript.
