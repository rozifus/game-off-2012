## Libraries Used
* [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) - The very awesome javascript game library.
* [(BKCore) Three.js-extensions](https://github.com/BKcore/Three.js-extensions/) - Nifty extensions for three.js.
* [HexGL](https://github.com/BKcore/HexGL) - Very impressive HTML5 game. I used this as a starting point for Gitium Chromoblockatics and as a reference for how to do object oriented programming in javascript.
